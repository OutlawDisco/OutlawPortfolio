# OutlawPortfolio

As a developer I want a solid working portfolio for potential employers so that they can review samples of my work and assess whether or not I'm a good candidate.

I've created a landing page for my portfolio with place-holder images for future projects. It has been an intense step by step process in which I have produced only the first draft of my potential portfolio.

With more time and practice, I hope to produce a much better working portfolio.
